> Use Multiple New Tab Extensions for Chrome & Firefox ðŸ˜œ

Just a simple extension to use multiple new tabs in Chrome & Firefox (currently doesn't work for Firefox, see [#1](https://github.com/deadcoder0904/multiple-new-tab/issues/1)).

[Alexander Sideris](https://twitter.com/alexsideris_) made it first but it had some configuration to set it up instead of directly working.

So I made this simple thing in which you wouldn't need to set up anything. All your New Extensions will be rotated everytime you create a New Tab. Its also took me <50 LOCs so wasn't too hard to build :)
